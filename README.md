Deep Reinforcement Learning for Chip Design with Heuristic Algorithm Refinement

This repository explores a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach combined with Heuristic Algorithm (HA) refinement for efficient circuit design optimization. The project focuses on achieving optimal power, area, and cost trade-offs during the design process.

Project Goals:

Leverage DRL for effective exploration of the design space, especially for simpler circuits.
Utilize HAs for targeted optimization in complex circuits, addressing specific goals like power reduction.
Achieve a balance between DRL exploration and HA guidance for efficient optimization.
Generalize the approach to handle diverse circuits with varying complexity levels.
Key Concepts:

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL): An AI technique where an agent learns through trial and error in a simulated environment, receiving rewards for desired actions.
Heuristic Algorithms (HAs): Domain-specific optimization techniques that provide efficient solutions based on experience or informed guesses.
Circuit Design Optimization: The process of designing circuits while minimizing power consumption, area footprint, and production cost while meeting functionality requirements.
Data Format:

The training data for the DRL agent consists of pairs of elements:

Circuit Description or Representation:

Hardware Description Language (HDL) Code: (e.g., Verilog) Defines the circuit's functionality and component interactions.
Netlist Representation: A text-based format explicitly defining components (gates, flip-flops) and their connections.
Corresponding Optimized Circuit Design (Optional):

May be provided for specific circuits, obtained through:
Manual design with optimization techniques in mind.
Existing circuit optimization tools.
Applying HAs for initial exploration.
If unavailable, the DRL agent learns optimizations during exploration.
GNN Processing:

Circuit descriptions and optimized designs are converted into graphs suitable for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):

Nodes: Represent components (gates, flip-flops).
Edges: Represent connections between components.
Node Features: Capture information like component type, estimated power consumption, area footprint, and cost.
Edge Features (Optional): May include signal type (data/clock) or routing information.
Potential Applications:

Design optimization for a wide range of circuits, from simple logic modules to complex processors.
Power-efficient design for battery-powered devices (e.g., I2C Slave circuit).
Area-optimized designs for cost-sensitive applications or chip size constraints (e.g., DMA or VGA controllers).
